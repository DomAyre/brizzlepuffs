// REQUIREMENTS

Make sure you have the latest version of Node.js installed, you can get it here: https://nodejs.org/en/

All the necessary node modules are stored locally, however the sqlite3 module used 
for the database is platform dependent so if you get errors while trying to run then 
just call "npm install sqlite3" and that should update the module for your system

// RUNNING THE SERVER

To run the server from the root directory, use the line: "node private/server.js".

// DATABASE

The database uses sqlite3 and there are guis available to view and manage the content
I recommend: http://sqlitebrowser.org
